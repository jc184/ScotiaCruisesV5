# ScotiaCruisesV5
This was a BSc Computing Third Year project for 'Designing Web-based Applications' at Moray College UHI (The University of the Highlands and Islands) under Lecturer Darryl Oatridge. 
This project is a work in progress. The first iteration had basic functionality but had several anomalies and was strewn with errors. I have made several 
revisions since it was first submitted and it is now in a state that it worth sharing online, although it still has some obvious issues. 
You can create the database in MySQL running 'CreateDatabaseRevA.sql' - this creates 'dwba_assessmentV5'. As its a MySQL database be sure to connect to localhost port 3306, with the user as 'root'
and the password as 'stcallans'.
