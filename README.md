# ScotiaCruisesV5
This was a BSc Computing (Software Development) Third Year project for 'Designing Web-based Applications' at Moray College UHI (The University of the Highlands and Islands) under Lecturer Darryl Oatridge. 
It is written in Java / JSP and uses Servlets as controllers and has model and DAO classes. This project is a work in progress. The first iteration had basic functionality but had several anomalies and was strewn with errors. I have made several 
revisions since it was first submitted and it is now in a state that it worth sharing online, although it still has some obvious issues. 
You can create the database in MySQL running 'CreateDatabaseRevA.sql' - this creates 'dwba_assessmentV5'. As its a MySQL database be sure to connect to localhost port 3306, with the user as 'root'
and the password as 'stcallans'.
To login as an admin user use 'admin' as the login username, and 'admin' as the login password. You can then browse the application. To use the application as a customer, first register / login with your username and password
