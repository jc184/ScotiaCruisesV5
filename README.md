# ScotiaCruisesV5
This was a BSc Computing (Software Development) Third Year project for 'Designing Web-based Applications' 
at Moray College UHI (The University of the Highlands and Islands) in Elgin in 2010-11.
It is written in Java / JSP and uses Servlets as controllers and has model and DAO classes. 
This project is still very much a work in progress. The first iteration had good basic functionality but had several 
anomalies and was strewn with errors. I have made several revisions since it was first submitted and it is 
now in a state that is worth sharing online, although it still has some obvious issues which need to be addressed.
 
There is one daily cruise per route, and three routes (322, 323 and 324), which are Morar to Rum return, Morar to Muck return, and Morar
to Eigg return. The vessels circumnavigate the islands in question and make stops to enable passengers to explore each of the Small Isles.

To login as an admin user use 'admin' as the login username, and 'admin' as the login password. You can then 
browse the application. To use the application as a customer, first register / login with your username and password.

The web application was created a few years ago now. If it was new, I would implement it with JSF or PrimeFaces, and also use Bootstrap,
but I will have to stick with JSP as overhauling the front end completely is too great a task for one person.

I welcome constructive feedback regarding this application. Feel free to use 'issues', or e-mail me, jc184, with feedback.
