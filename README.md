This was a BSc Computing Third Year project for 'Designing Web-based Applications' at Moray College UHI (The University of the Highlands and Islands) under Lecturer Darryl Oatridge. 
This project is a work in progress. The first iteration had basic functionality but had several anomalies and was strewn with errors. I have made several 
revisions since it was first submitted and it is now in a state that it worth sharing online. You can create the database in MySQL running 'CreateDatabaseRevA.sql'
